# Datepicker by Solverix – Support

## Overview
Datepicker by Solverix is a Power BI custom visual that provides advanced date filtering capabilities, including preset ranges, custom ranges, and ISO-compliant calendar logic.

The visual is designed to replace or enhance the default Power BI date slicer with a more flexible and user-friendly experience.

---

## Getting Started
1. Import **Datepicker by Solverix** from Microsoft AppSource.
2. Add the visual to your Power BI report.
3. Bind a field of type **Date** or **DateTime**.
4. Select a preset range or define a custom date range.
5. The visual will apply filters to other visuals on the page.

---

## Common Issues
- Ensure the bound field is of type **Date** or **DateTime**.
- Verify that page-level or report-level filters are not overriding the visual.
- If filters appear incorrect, clear existing filters and reapply the selection.

---

## Data & Security
- The visual runs entirely inside Power BI.
- No external network requests are performed.
- No data is transmitted, stored, or logged outside the report.
